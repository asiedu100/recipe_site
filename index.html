<H4>Instructions</H4>         
<ol>
<li>Prepare the Pasta: Cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente, according to the package instructions.</li>
<li>Cook the Pancetta: While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the pancetta and whole garlic cloves. Cook until the pancetta is crispy and the garlic is browned. Remove the garlic cloves and discard.</li>
<li>Mix the Eggs and Cheese: In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and mix in the grated pecorino and parmesan cheese.</li>
<li>Combine Pasta and Pancetta: Drain the spaghetti, reserving some of the pasta water. Add the spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta and toss to combine.</li>
<li>Create the Sauce: Remove the skillet from the heat and quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture, tossing continuously to create a creamy sauce. If the mixture is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water.</li>
<li>Season and Serve: Season with freshly ground black pepper and salt to taste. Garnish with chopped parsley if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
